# Autochess-game

This is a project I used to work on in Unity. The goal was the creation of a TeamfightTactics like game.

I sadly abandoned the project after successfully creating the fighting system as well as making all the core game functionalities, as I would have had to spend a lot of time learning 3D modelling and animations.
